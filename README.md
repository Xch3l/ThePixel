# ThePixel
Spawns a dead pixel with a 25% chance of it being a 2x2 square

## Colors
Appears in 8 nifty colors!

- Red
- Green
- Blue
- Yellow
- Cyan
- Magenta
- "Always on" white
- and "Totes dead" black!

## Getting rid of it

There's two ways:
- The normal way: Once you've found the fake dead pixel, click it and it'll be gone
- The cheater: Use the Task Manager to kill the executable

## Compiling

I used [Dev-Cpp](https://bloodshed.net/devcpp.html) version 4.9.9.2 on a Windows XP machine so it should be pretty straight forward to open and compile even on modern systems.
